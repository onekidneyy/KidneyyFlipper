# KidneyyFlipper

This is my personal github repo of all my projects for the flipperzero.
For best experience I recommend reading the README for each folder so you now what you are downloading and how to set it up on your own flipper.

## Overview Of The Open Source Apps

* Skeleton App

Skeleton folder holds a base setup to create apps from the flipper that has three menus a Config, Play, and About.

## Overview Of The Scripts
