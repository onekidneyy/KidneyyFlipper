# KidneyyFlipper

This is my personal github repo of all my projects for the flipperzero. For best experience I recommend reading the README for each folder so you know what you are downloading and how to set it up on your own flipper.

## Overview Of The Exported Apps / Open Source Appss

* Sample App

Sample folder holds a base setup to create apps for the Flipper Zero that has three menus a Config, Play, and About.

* Skeleton App

Skeleton folder holds a more advanced version of the Sample App this setup has all the menus interconnected for you to see how it could look.

* Solana Wallet App (WIP)

A Solana Wallet Private key generator and physical transcation approver.

* To Do List App (WIP)

A app that allows you type out tasks and save them and then view in another menu.

## Overview Of The Scripts

* Hello World

The first script I made for the flipper zero, run it on your device for it to say "Hello World"

* Random Number 1-100

This script once ran will generate a random number between 1 - 100 on the device.
  
* Temperature Converter (WIP)

A temperature converter that allows you to convert from celcius or farenheigt.
